# COVID-Impact-2022

## Purpose 

To analyze COVID data through 2022 in order to visualize its impact and provide stats for each continent.  


## Findings

* **Europe** was hit the hardest, accounting for **29.5% cases** and **35.9% deaths** worldwide even though it only makes up 9% of the world population. 
* **Asia** has the most active and recently-diagnosed cases, making up **90% of new cases** and having **two of the five** countries with the highest number of non-recovered cases.
* Only **1.3%** of all cases resulted in **death**, which is low for a disease (e.g., flu mortality rate is almost 4%.)
